I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Economics at the University of Toronto and the Manager of the Toronto Experimental Economics Lab ([TEEL](https://teel.economics.utoronto.ca)).

My research lies at the intersection of behavioral economics, microeconomic theory, and experimental economics. I am currently working on how individuals learn, remember, and make decisions under uncertainty and over time. I use theoretical and experimental methods to study these questions.

I will be on the 2025-2026 job market.
