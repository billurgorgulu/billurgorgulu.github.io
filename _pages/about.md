I am an Assistant Professor in Operations Management, at the [DeGroote School of Business](https://www.degroote.mcmaster.ca/), at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/). My research focuses on constructing data-driven, realistic models of healthcare operations and developing predictive and prescriptive analytics to support decision-making under uncertainty. My research methodologies include stochastic modeling and optimization, queueing theory, interpretable machine learning, and Markov decision processes.
