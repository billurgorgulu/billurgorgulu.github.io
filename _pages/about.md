I am the Manager of the Toronto Experimental Economics Lab ([TEEL](https://teel.economics.utoronto.ca)), and a PhD candidate at the Department of Economics.

I am interested in behavioral economics, microeconomic theory, and experimental economics. My current research interest is on memory, learning, and decision making under uncertainty and over time.
