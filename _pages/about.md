I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Toronto and the Manager of the Toronto Experimental Economics Lab ([TEEL](https://teel.economics.utoronto.ca)).

My research interests span behavioral economics, microeconomic theory, and experimental economics. I study decision-making in contexts such as how individuals learn and recall information, how they make choices under uncertainty and across time, how they establish and respond to trust, and how they behave in matching markets. My approach integrates theoretical modeling with experimental methods.

I am on the 2025-2026 job market.
