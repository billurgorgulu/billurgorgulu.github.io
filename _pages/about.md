I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Economics at the University of Toronto, and the Manager of the Toronto Experimental Economics Lab ([TEEL](https://teel.economics.utoronto.ca)).

My research interests are behavioral economics, microeconomic theory, and experimental economics. I am currently working on memory, learning, and decision making under uncertainty and over time. I use theoretical and experimental methods to explore decision making.

I will be on the 2025-2026 job market.
